The recent Elevens-Board-Game Project has been added to this folder. This AP CS assignment has been revised by me in some perspectives. e.g. the private keyword in the Elevens.java file has been changed to protected for more elegant codes.

Comit two recent projects into the folder. The `SortingProject` is to make a phonebook with functions such as adding/deleting/setting personal information, writing/reading to file, and sorting. The other project is in the `20180306` folder, which records answers to a set of AP CS problems.
//TODO add information about `holiday project` and finish the `SortingProject`//
