For storing AP Computer Science documents &amp; assignments

In the Java group project, my teammates have difficulty understanding abstract class and interface, as well as the difference between them. Add a file to this repository that explains these concepts with codes.

The recent Elevens-Board-Game Project has been added to this folder. This AP CS assignment has been revised by me in some perspectives. e.g. the private keyword in the Elevens.java file has been changed to protected for more elegant codes.

Comit two recent projects into the folder. The `SortingProject` is to make a phonebook with functions such as adding/deleting/setting personal information, writing/reading to file, and sorting. The other project is in the `20180306` folder, which records answers to a set of AP CS problems.

Sorry to omit the `holiday project` which I've done during the holidays (in fact that is a homework currently). The project involves various methods for image-processing. A complete GUI-based project, it also offers effective uses of CardLayout and etc.

The BookProject is updated. An extension from the library_project I did before for AP CS, this project now incorporates design pattern which makes the codes more effective, resuable, and concise. The web part of this project is left to be done by Jeffson.

(The sorting project's IO functions has been finished, now struggling over which type of file to store the information)
Refine the sorting algorithm behind the sorting project `Bubble Sorting --> Selection Sorting/ Insertion Sorting`. This change is only intended to beautify the codes. 

P.S. new functionalities are successfully added to the program. Now it seems less like a toy than an imitation to a practical software. Autoloading and autosaving are added, so that the information users store will remain every time the program is executed.
